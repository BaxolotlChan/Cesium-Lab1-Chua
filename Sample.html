	           <h1>Genshin Impact</h1>
		       <p>Genshin Impact is a free to play action role-playing game that features an anime-style open-world environment 
			   and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. 
			   The game takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god (archon). 
			   The story follows The Traveler, an interstellar adventurer who, at the start of the game, is separated from their twin sibling after the two land in Teyvat. 
			   Thereafter, the Traveler journeys across the nations of Teyvat in search of the lost sibling, accompanied by their guide, Paimon. 
			   Along the way, the two befriend myriad individuals, become involved in the affairs of its nations, and begin to unravel the mysteries of the land. </p>
